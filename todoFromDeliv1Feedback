* Authors are to be connected with Publications, not Titles.
* Not every title has a review.
* There exist unpublished titles and publications that comprise
multiple titles.
* A general comment: Once you load the data, you may have to
calibrate your participation and key constraints.
Some may need to be more lax, and some more restrictive.
For example, there actually are awards not corresponding to an
explicit title in the dataset.
Are there publications without publishers? Authors without
publications? Can a review refer to more than one titles, or only one
of them?
* Consider treating award categories as a weak entity of award types.
Also reflect this modeling in the relational schema -- it will
probably simplify your rationale for award categories and types.
After looking at the data, you will notice that there's a 1-1
relationship between Notes and the rest of the tables. Therefore,
perhaps it is more convenient to inline notes information in each
table when translating to the relational model.
* I wouldn't call a relationship 'can win'. Awards have already been
won.
* You might want to treat currencies more explicitly, instead of just
char values that will need parsing for every access to them.
