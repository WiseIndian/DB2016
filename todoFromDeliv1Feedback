* DONE in create-table: Authors are to be connected with Publications, not Titles.

(was already the case in the create table, we had created a relationship called
title_is_reviewed_by that is clearly many to many from the code)
* Not every title has a review.

DONE* There exist unpublished titles and publications that comprise
multiple titles.
Actually our create table code reflects already "There exist unpublished titles"  
The dilemna now is that if we use the title in publications.csv as a way to find a title id
we might indeed find many titles, because the title field in the csv file is a string.

so, one option is to create a view/relationship called Title_Publications(or something like this) of the form whose schema represents the fact that there is a many to many relationship between title and
publications (see Manos's comment deliv1):
CREATE TABLE Title_Publications (
  title_id INTEGER,
  pub_id INTEGER, 
  PRIMARY KEY (title_id, pub_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (title_id) REFERENCES Titles(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (pub_id) REFERENCES Publications(id)
)
We have to create it once we've create Publications(see changes on title field of Publications in 
create table).
once Title and Publications are created:
use a sql command to create the Title_Publications view,
that by doing the following query that also creates the table:


CREATE TABLE Title_Publications ( 
		title_id INTEGER,
		pub_id INTEGER, 
		PRIMARY KEY (title_id, pub_id),
		FOREIGN KEY (title_id) REFERENCES Titles(id),
		FOREIGN KEY (pub_id) REFERENCES Publications(id)
	)
	SELECT t.id AS title_id, p.id AS pub_id
	FROM Publications p, Titles t
	WHERE p.title = t.title

* A general comment: Once you load the data, you may have to
calibrate your participation and key constraints.
Some may need to be more lax, and some more restrictive.
For example, there actually are awards not corresponding to an
explicit title in the dataset. (NOTE Simon: Example seems to be agree with our constraints)
Are there publications without publishers? Authors without
publications? Can a review refer to more than one titles, or only one
of them?
DONE: * Consider treating award categories as a weak entity of award types.
*Also reflect this modeling in the relational schema -- it will
probably simplify your rationale for award categories and types.
DONE:*After looking at the data, you will notice that there's a 1-1
relationship between Notes and the rest of the tables. Therefore,
perhaps it is more convenient to inline notes information in each
table when translating to the relational model.

DONE(on create table): * I wouldn't call a relationship 'can win'. Awards have already been
won.
DONE(on create table) : * You might want to treat currencies more explicitly, instead of just
char values that will need parsing for every access to them.
